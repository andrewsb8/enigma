# Enigma

This project will be an engine for Advance Wars, akin to Stockfish or equivalent. It is named Enigma after the mission which introduces Sturm in AW1 and also because it will utilize neural networks which are largely black boxes, which means their inner mechanisms are enigmatic.

## Run and Build

From top level directory, run

```$ go run src/enigma.go [options]```

To build, from top level directory, run

```$ go build src/enigma.go```

Which will make a binary in the top level directory which can be run by the command
